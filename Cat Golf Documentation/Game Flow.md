The player experience can be split into these three distinct stages.

- [[Pre Game]] will facilitate player actions before they begin their game session

- [[In Game]] will carry out the gameplay for the player to engage in with their friends

- [[Sur Game]] will let the player reflex on their session and decide their next action whether to stop or to begin another
