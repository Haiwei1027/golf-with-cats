A multiplayer golf game with paws instead

# how-does-it-work
The core premise of the game is that you don't control the cats just like how you don't own your cats, you can attempt to lure the cats to do certain actions by throwing treats or toys. For example, if your cat is behind your ball and you throw a toy in front of the ball the cat might run towards the toy and in turn kick your ball in that direction. Also, your cat could be distracted by an obstacle on the course so you have to plan your path accordingly.
Furthermore, depending on the cat you pick they might have different personalities with different traits that are yet to be decided

To make the experience more engaging I envision each course to be semi-procedural and during a playthrough the player can obtain power ups to help them through the series of obstacles they will face.
